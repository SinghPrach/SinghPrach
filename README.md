<dl>
  <dt>Technology Consultant, Data & Analytics, <b>PwC India</b>, July 2022-present</dt>
  <dd><b>Project 1: Big Data Engineer Analyst | Supply Chain</b></dd>
  <dd>Tech-Stack: Python, PySpark, Spark SQL, Spark SQL expressions</dd>
  <dd><b>Achieved Target:</b> Develop a planning tool (optimiser) in Pyspark and python to maximise the gross margin of an FMCG company, ensuring optimisation of supply chain, capacity utilisation, and working capital.</dd>
  <dd>- Performed data engineering and What-If analysis for data (weekly incremental) from around 20 sources (excel, SQL tables, clientâ€™s data lake).</dd>
  <dd>- Implemented the Azure delta lake model, maintaining 3 layers- Bronze, Silver, and Gold in the ADLS Gen 2 container.</dd>
  <dd>- Collaborated with PowerApps development to ensure smooth flow of data between ADLS and Dataverse and created event based triggers in ADF as per the clientâ€™s requirement.</dd>
  <dd><b>Impact on Business: </b>Realised an increase in Gross Profit of 10-13 Crores INR per annum for the corresponding product segment. STN increase of over 20% with respect to the set target level.</dd>
<dd><b>Project 2: Big Data Engineer Analyst | Supply Chain</b></dd>
  <dd>Tech-Stack: PySpark, SQL, MS Azure</dd>
  <dd><b>Achieved Target:</b> Build a Python solution that provides analysis of consumed raw materials, costs of making, and turnover of the entire business for an FMCG.</dd>
  <dd>- Developed a total of 9 Databricks notebooks and 5 ADF pipelines for ETL, for end goal of visualisation in 5 dashboards (400-600 global users).</dd>
  <dd>- Incremental (monthly and weekly) data load with source (Manual Excel files, csv, and clientâ€™s data lake) varying from 2000 MB to 10 TB.</dd>
  <dd>- Computed around 30-40 new metrics for each notebook as a part of transformation, in addition to data cleaning and used SQL for data querying and manipulation.</dd>
  <dd>- Maintained datawarehouse using MS SQL Server and used SQL for analysing data as per clientâ€™s requirement.</dd>
  <dd><b>Impact on Business: </b>Reduction in wastage of raw materials and packaging materials of over 350K SKUs, produced in over 1500 sourcing units spread across the 6 continents (Asia, North America, South America, Africa, Europe, Australia).</dd>
  <dd><b>Project 3: Big Data Engineer | Retail</b></dd>
  <dd>Tech-Stack: PySpark, Python</dd>
  <dd><b>Achieved Target:</b> Preparation of data, to be used for forecasting demand of the retail products.</dd>
  <dd>- Worked with 3 datasets- primary sales, secondary sales, and promotional to achieve maximum revenue during any promotion/ad camapaigns.</dd>
  <dd>- Performed data engineering on consumer salesâ€™ data. The resultant dataset was later consumed by a team of data scientists to predict prices and discounts on the products. </dd>
  <dd><b>Impact on Business: </b>Tracked historical trends keeping promotional discounts and holidays in consideration, which led Business take decisions.</dd>
  <dt>Summer Research Intern, <b>Defence Research and Development Laboratory, DRDO</b>, June 2021-Aug 2021</dt>
  <dd><b>Achieved Target:</b> Build a solution that provides information on thermal behaviour of the internal and external environment of missile-shaped bodies.</dd>
<dd><b>Impact on Business:</b> Designed the numerical model that estimates the wall temperature, internal flow variation, and ablation model with an accuracy of about 90 percent.</dd>
